Here are the slides and videos I showed at my recent talk at a COMS seminar. COMS is the virtual *[Center for Comutational Molecular Sciences](http://proteinsandwavefunctions.blogspot.com/)* at KU. I'm using youtube to share the videos. The videos were created using the excellent [PyMOL MovieSchool](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/MovieSchool). Remember to have [FreeMOL](http://www.freemol.org/) installed when you wish to save the movie as an MPEG video file. I'm using the public folder in my [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/) to share the slides. Couldn't be much easier ..

... or could it be any easier? In my next presentation I will include a link to this blog using a QR code on the last slide like this (created using <http://qrcode.kaywa.com/> - for free):
