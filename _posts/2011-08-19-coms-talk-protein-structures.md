Here are the slides and videos I showed at my recent talk at a **COMS seminar**.  
COMS is the virtual *[Center for Computational Molecular Sciences](http://proteinsandwavefunctions.blogspot.com/)* at KU.

I'm using YouTube to share the videos. The videos were created using the excellent  
[PyMOL MovieSchool](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/MovieSchool).  
If you want to save the movie as an MPEG video file, remember to have [FreeMOL](http://www.freemol.org/) installed.

The slides are shared via my [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) public folder. Couldn't be much easier...

### ... or could it be any easier?

In my next presentation, Iâ€™ll include a link to this blog post as a **QR code** on the last slide, like this:
