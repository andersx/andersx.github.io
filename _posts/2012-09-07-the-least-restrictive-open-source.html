<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am working on a program to predict protein chemical shifts and predict protein structural features from chemical shifts. I want my work to be available to anyone, for any purpose, free of charge. Would be nice if the work would remain attributed to the respective authors, and finally I don't want to get sued under any circumstances.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Although widely used, the least restrictive open source software license is certainly not the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. I wouldn't mind having my code used for commercial purposes, for instance.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I also considered something along the lines of what is suggested <a href="http://www.coderanch.com/t/132890/gc/least-restrictive-software-license">here</a>:</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="postbody"> Steal this code and use it for whatever 
you want. No support or guarantee is provided or implied - use at your 
own risk. Attribution would be nice but not essential.</span></span></blockquote>
</div>
However, after searching around a bit, I settled for the "2-clause Simplified <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD License</a>":<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

Only question is why the 2nd half is written entirely in CAPS!
