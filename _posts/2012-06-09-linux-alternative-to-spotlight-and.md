I really like the work flow of "run command" alt+f2 in most of the linux distros, but i would like to extend the functionality from just running a command to search etc.



I really dig the [spotlight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_%28software%29) functionality on Mac OS X, and the startmenu functionality of windows.

| windows 7 - start menu |

| OS X - Spotlight |








I tried alternatives like The Synapse Launcher, Gnome Do and Google Desktop Search, but they seemed slow and very slow (and everyone working with unity will tell you how much of a pain alt+f2 is when it is slow).



I finally found [Kupfer](http://kaizer.se/wiki/kupfer/), which is really cool. Check it out in this video for an longer introduction of kupfer:














Personally I use Kupfer under LXDE which works great.
