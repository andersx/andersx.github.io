Just found these two neat methods which I wish to share with the rest of the world. I wish the mainstream channels (iTunes store, etc.) was this easy. Personally, I put my own MP3 library into my Spotify and wirelessly synch my with iPhone and iPad. No virtual machines needed to synch via iTunes no more. Yay.




Anyways, on to the news here ... The first of these two gems is called GrooveDown. It uses the GrooveShark API and connects to GrooveShark's music library. It's written in Java so it's also platform independent - a plus for us linux people. Just search for any artist or song and add it to the download list. GrooveDown will then connect and download the selected songs in MP3 format.Â  It IS as easy as it sounds.




Download GrooveDown here: <http://groovedown.me/>

The second method is to extract audio from YouTube videos. This is super easy. Hop on to a website called <http://www.vidtomp3.com/> and simply paste the URL for the YouTube video. Seconds later you are presented with a download link for an MP3-file containing the audio of the YouTube video. I can't see how this could be done any easier.
