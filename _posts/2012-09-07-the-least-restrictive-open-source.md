I am working on a program to predict protein chemical shifts and predict protein structural features from chemical shifts. I want my work to be available to anyone, for any purpose, free of charge. Would be nice if the work would remain attributed to the respective authors, and finally I don't want to get sued under any circumstances.

Although widely used, the least restrictive open source software license is certainly not the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). I wouldn't mind having my code used for commercial purposes, for instance.




I also considered something along the lines of what is suggested [here](http://www.coderanch.com/t/132890/gc/least-restrictive-software-license):

However, after searching around a bit, I settled for the "2-clause Simplified [BSD License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses)":

Only question is why the 2nd half is written entirely in CAPS!
