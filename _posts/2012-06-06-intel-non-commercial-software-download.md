It always takes me quite a while to dig my way through Intel's very messy website. To get to the free non-commercial software follow this link:




<http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/non-commercial-software-download/>




There are tons of useful things in there, such as **ifort**, **icc**, **icpc** and MKL (Intel's optimized LAPACK and BLAS implementations and more). You have to register, but pretty much everything is free as long as your work is non-commercial.

Another very useful page is the MKL Link Line Advisor:

Pretty much invaluable unless you know the flags by heart (sadly, I do!). Happy **`ifort -O3`**-ing!
