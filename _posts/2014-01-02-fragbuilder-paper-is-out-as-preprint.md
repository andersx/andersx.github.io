Our latest papers on the FragBuilder Python library is out as preprint from PeerJ, while it is undergoing peer-review.



PeerJ is in my opinion awesome for this type of publications, demonstating the use of a Python library, since they even allow examples and code-bits in the paper.



You can see the preprint here: <https://peerj.com/preprints/169v2/>



We even got DOI and can be cited as:

The FragBuilder Python library can be found at GitHub: <https://github.com/jensengroup/fragbuilder>



I am in the process of making a couple of more blog-posts to demonstrate the use of FragBuilder, stay tuned!
