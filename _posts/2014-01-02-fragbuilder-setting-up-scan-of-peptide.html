This post covers the essentials of how to set up a scan of different peptide conformations. We have used this method to calculate more than 1.5M QM calculation on model peptides in our group.<br />
<br />
In this example we make a tri-glycine peptide and scan over the phi/psi torsion angles between -180 and 180 degrees with 60 degrees spacing.<br />
<br />
For each conformation, the MMFF94 force field energy is printed and the structure is saved as an XYZ file.<br />
