This is a very interesting video about the general field of computational protein structure prediction - the field in which I am involved. It's a talk by Professor David Baker, Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Washington - probably better known as the guy behind stuff like [ROSETTA](http://boinc.bakerlab.org/) and [FoldIt](http://fold.it/portal/).
