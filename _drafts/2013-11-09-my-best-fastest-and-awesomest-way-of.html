If you use this post you will accomplish the following:<br />
<ol>
<li>Be able Include loss-less vector graphics in your Latex document (good).</li>
<li>Be able to select text inside figures with mouse (awesome).</li>
<li>Compile your latex document with figures faster (probably).</li>
<li>Make your files smaller and of  higher quality (mostly).</li>
<li>That's it. The rest is up to you!</li>
</ol>
I see many people still using .eps files from matplotlib in their otherwise nicely formatted Latex document.&nbsp; Forget this. From this post on we use matplotlib figures in .pdf format. It works exactly as with .eps or .png or what else you might be using:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/andersx/7385833.js"></script>
Let's also use pdflatex for compiling (just replace the latex command):<br />
<br />
<pre><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: large;">andersx@awesome:~/my_paper$ pdflatex mypaper.tex</span></span>
</pre>
<br />
This will also compile much faster than standard latex (using, say, .png-files), since you are now including something that is already in pdf-format. <br />
<br />
Last two steps are (1) to save your file as a .pdf-file and (2) autocrop the white borders (loss-less). Step one is accomplished using standard matplotlib/pylab/etc. syntax. The 2nd part is done using a tool called pdfcrop (which is already included in you have latex installed). I prefer to call pdfcrop from within the Python script to avoid having to run more than one command each time I make a new figure.<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/andersx/7385821.js"></script>

The above is some boilerplate code. The result is:<br />
<br />
<pre><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: large;">andersx@awesome:~/my_paper$ python my_figure.py 
PDFCROP 1.33, 2012/02/01 - Copyright (c) 2002-2012 by Heiko Oberdiek.
==&gt; 1 page written on `my_file.pdf'.
andersx@awesome:~/my_paper$</span></span></pre>
<br />
Now you have a beautifully formatted pdf-file to include in&nbsp; your latex document.<br />
<br />
I might edit this post later with a bit of bling and YOLO/swag just to give it the attractive combination of vitality and glamour it deserves.<br />
