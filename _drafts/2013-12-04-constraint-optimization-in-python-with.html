This post is just a quick post to show, how you can optimize molecules with harmonic constraints in Python with Open Babel. This requires Open Babel to be compiled with Python SWIG-bindings. <br />
<br />
There are three types of constraints, distances, angles and torsions. Here is a gist that might help get you started. <br />
