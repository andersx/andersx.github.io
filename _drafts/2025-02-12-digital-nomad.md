Traveling office, working abroad and digital nomad setup.
So, you want to be a digital nomad? I have some notes for you.

I really want to optimize the way I am working when traveling,
as I am lucky enough to do that from time to time. Hobbiest digital nomad.
This is a small guide on how I setup a to-go workstation.
(*And if my boss is reading this, nono, I am just working from home today. Definitely not in Portugal surfing!*).

I hate working from my laptop only. My posture is shit, screen feels claustrophobic and keyboard (especially Mac) feels terrible. So I need something portable that can compete with my nice monitor-arm setup at home. The idea is to get a portable monitor and a tripod.

## Mouse and keyboard

I am a creature of habit, and I prefer to use the same keyboard and mouse working from home, in the office and on the go. Also when I play computer, which is why my mouse and keyboard is a bit overkill.

## USB Hub

I use a UNI USB-C hub that can handle USB-c charger, so I can use it as a hub and charge my laptop at the same time.

## Webcam, microphone and sound

I don't need a webcam, my laptop has one. And for microphone and sound I use "Bose QuietComfort Earbuds", which is nice with noise-cancellation.

## Monitor

There are many options, in varying price ranges. Here are some notes to look out for.

- Choose a inch size that is comfortable for you traveling with. I suggest **16-18" range**.
- Get anything with a **1920x1080** (1080p) resolution. Usually it is the same resolution, no matter the screen physical size.
- It **needs VESA mount**, preferably with **M4 screw size**.
- You can use a VESA mount with two or four screws. My experience is two is enough when the screw is thick enough.
- Note the length of the screw, as it needs to be precise. Use washers when needed.

> **_WARNING_:** Do not buy a monitor with **M3 screw size** VESA mount. The screws are simply too small, and will not hold anything. I tried it, and with any weight it falls apart.

> Note: ASUS made a ZenScreen MB16QHG Portable Monitor, which seems interesting. Also because it has a tripod mount build in. But a bit expensive.
