<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
I recently fell in love with <a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3</a>wm, a tile window manager, so I wanted to format my computer and have a bare-minimum installation (instead of running gnome in the background). I checked out tile-window-managers after using pywo, and wanted to 'go the extra mile'.<br />
<br />
This resulted in me downloading the minimal CD from ubuntu (12.04) and installing X, i3 and a smallest login manager I could find.<br />
<br />
I just ordered the ASUS UX31A and so I need to install everything from scratch again, so what I did was to create a github project with bash file installing all the nice small packages from the first time.<br />
<br />

<br />
Here is an outline of the install script, which&nbsp;basicly&nbsp;uses apt-get (why I choose ubuntu) and installs everything needed.<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3612510.js?file=i3-minimal-setup"></script>

<br />
Afterwards all the setup RC's, icon, font setup is done via setup.sh.<br />
<br />
I really like this setup for a fast on-the-go geeky setup, especially on a 13" where room on the screen is limited.</div>
