In this blog I demonstrate how you can create an Amazon EC2 instance image that will automount a folder on a remote server via SSHFS.<br />
The purpose here is to fire up a EC2 compute server, run a program and save the output from that program on our local compute cluster at the university.<br /><br />Basically, you just need to a line to /etc/fstab and save the instance as an image (that's what I did).<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>An Amazon EC2 instance with sshfs installed.</li>
<li>A user with SSH keys properly setup to the remote system (the SSH keys cannot require a passphrase).</li>
</ul>
Your remote server has a folder that is named remote_folder and your instance has a folder named local_folder. The default username on Amazon is "Ubuntu" for Ubuntu instances, so I'm using this as an example. <br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">sshfs#ubuntu@remoteserver:/home/ubuntu/remote_folder/ /home/ubuntu/local_folder/&nbsp; fuse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user,delay_connect,_netdev,reconnect,uid=1000,gid=1000,IdentityFile=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa,idmap=user,allow_other,workaround=rename&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 </span></b><br />
<br />
Everything is one long line that goes into /etc/fstab. The IdentityFile points to your SSH key. You need the "_netdev" keywords to mount the SSHFS folder after network becomes available. The "reconnect" keyword does what it reads, so throw that in as well.<br />
I read a few posts from other people who had difficulties mounting SSHFS properly without the "delay_connect" and "workaround=rename" keywords, so I added those for good measure.<br />
<br />
Note that you need the trailing / after the folder names! I won't work without (and I'm talking from bitter experience here). <br />
<br />
Furthermore, you want to add the following line to /etc/ssh/ssh_config<br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ServerAliveInterval 5</span></b><br />
<br />
This makes SSH send a keep alive signal every 5 seconds so you don't get disconnected due to being idle. <br />
<br />
Apart from that I think the above should be self-explanatory (for someone looking for this information).<br />
