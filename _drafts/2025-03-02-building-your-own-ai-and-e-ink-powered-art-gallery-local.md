I want to build a home e-ink based picture, where the content is generated by AI diffusion models.
So every morning I will have new art and wonder "what is that?".
I also require that the whole project is done locally on my own local network, because nobody needs to know what I have on my walls.

This is a project that we started in Feb 2024, and took some interations before we got it right.
In the mean time many commercial products has appeared.
