<div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">If you try and install <a href="http://openmopac.net/MOPAC2009.html">MOPAC2009</a> on a standard <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/business/desktop/long-term-support">Ubuntu 10.04 LTS</a> system, you will get a very weird problem. I unzipped MOPAC2009 in <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/opt/mopac</span> as described in the installation guide. However, when I tried to run the executable I got a very odd message:</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">-bash: ./MOPAC2009.exe: No such file or directory</span></div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">How odd is that? I could see the executable with <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ls</span> and I even tabbed my way to the full filename. Unrelated to the actual error message, it turns out, that the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">MOPAC2009.exe</span> executable is compiled as 32-bit, and not 64-bit as you'd expect in 2011, and it is actually here the problem lies - not a missing file! First, let me give the remedy, then my rant. You need to install a set of 32-bit compatible libraries that will let 32-bit code run. Since we're running Ubuntu, this is of course easy as pie!</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; text-align: justify;">sudo apt-get install ia32-libs</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">But very odd, that I get a complaint saying <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">"No such file or directory"</span>! Really! I was going nuts and had started blaming the NFS file system. A big thanks to my favorite web-site <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/">ubuntuforums.org</a>, where I found other possible causes for missing files, other than actual missing files.</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; color: black; text-align: center;"><a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/"><img border="0" src="http://ubuntuforums.org/images/misc/ubuntulogo.png" /></a></div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">However, the take home message of my post here really is: Start distributing <b>source codes!</b> I'm sure it's possible for users to compile Mopac (written in Fortran 90/95), if a decent Makefile is included. This would be the only drawback in distributing source codes. Another thing is, that binaries makes it impossible to optimize code at compiletime and link to optimal BLAS routines, etc.</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;But these are not the big issues here. The things that really matter are: (1) You will never discover bugs from binaries and (2) you will never know what exact setting your algorithms are using from binaries. What if you needed to slightly tweak a parameter somewhere? What is you get unexpected results, and you know the input is good? You should of course turn to the source code! I have myself found bugs/quirks in both <a href="http://dirac.chem.sdu.dk/daltonprogram.org/">Dalton</a> and <a href="http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/">GAMESS</a>.</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">I had a Dalton calculation that kept crashing, and found a coefficient which was mis-typed. I quickly contacted the authors and things were solved SAME DAY, and the fix lives on in the new DALTON2011!</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">In GAMESS (and this is an even better story!) I discovered how to have semi-empirical methods run in parallel after snooping around in the code for a couple of days, looking for the Fock-matrix diagonalization routines. Turns out, that the only thing that prevents parallel semi-empirical methods is a flag in the code - remove that and voila!</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">Unfortunately cheerful stories as these will never happen to programs such as MOPAC. And I'm willing to bet money, that Mr. MOPAC would really prefer to receive a bug report along with a code patch, rather than just the bug reports.</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;">MOPAC2009 is even free for academic use, and Jimmy Stewart (AKA Mr. MOPAC) has even been helpful in getting us started with a GAMESS implementation of his newest PM6 method. Thanks Jimmy!</div><div style="color: black; text-align: justify;"><br />
</div>UPDATE: Another thing concerning installation of MOPAC2009. The installation guide recommends using 777 permission for the installation. This is dangerous, and means that EVERYONE has write permissions to that folder. Stick with 755, which only gives the owner write permission - otherwise that file is an easy target for a hacker. 777 - bad, unless really necessary !
