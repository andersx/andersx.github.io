Our latest papers on the FragBuilder Python library is out as preprint from PeerJ, while it is undergoing peer-review.<br />
<br />
PeerJ is in my opinion awesome for this type of publications, demonstating the use of a Python library, since they even allow examples and code-bits in the paper.<br />
<br />
You can see the preprint here: <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/169v2/">https://peerj.com/preprints/169v2/</a><br />
<br />
We even got DOI and can be cited as:<br />

The FragBuilder Python library can be found at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jensengroup/fragbuilder">https://github.com/jensengroup/fragbuilder</a><br />

I am in the process of making a couple of more blog-posts to demonstrate the use of FragBuilder, stay tuned!
